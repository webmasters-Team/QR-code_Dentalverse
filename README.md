## 👨‍💻 Contributing
⛔ **This is a personal project, so we’re not accepting general pull requests at the moment — however, localizations are always welcome!**

If you have any suggestions or you want to report a bug please open an [issue](https://github.com/mmarfat/qrisp/issues).

However, if you fork this repo and want to allow contributions we recommend the following approach:
#### 1. Clone the repository:
First, clone the repository and checkout the `dev` branch:

```
git clone https://github.com/mmarfat/qrisp
cd qrisp
git checkout dev
```

#### 2. Create an appropriate branch:
Create a new branch from `dev` with an appropriate name (e.g., `qr-generation-speedup` or `qr-generation-fix`):

```
git checkout -b qr-generation-speedup
```

#### 3. Make your changes:
Implement changes on your branch.

#### 4. ⚠️ Sync your branch with the latest dev:
Before creating a pull request, ensure your branch is up-to-date with the latest changes from `dev`. Follow these steps to sync:

First, checkout `dev` and pull the latest changes:
```
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
```

Then, switch back to your feature branch and merge the changes from `dev` into your branch:
```
git checkout feature/new-feature
git merge dev
```

Resolve any conflicts that may occur.

#### 5. Create a Pull Request:
Once your changes are ready and you've synced your branch with `dev`, create a pull request (PR) to merge your branch into the `dev` branch. The maintainer will review your PR and merge it if everything looks good.
